# Vanilla Js app

This repo was maked to follow Fernando Herrera's course, like blackjack repo.

In this case we are making a todo app using just vanilla an d the base configuration of webpack to know how to configure it without frameworks; but this is a little diferent from the course code because I'm trying to do somethings in my way.
